## Estimate Costs


### [Estimate the monthly cost of the planner infrastructure](https://github.com/herrera-luis/cloud_architect_resources/blob/master/Design%20for%20Performance%20and%20Scalability/Estimate%20Costs/Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv) 

The monthly cost is between $8,000-10,000 using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator

### [Modify the infrastructure to reduce the monthly cost](https://github.com/herrera-luis/cloud_architect_resources/blob/master/Design%20for%20Performance%20and%20Scalability/Estimate%20Costs/Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv) 

* The infrastructure includes all required services to run properly
* The monthly cost is $6,500 or below using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator
* A rationale is provided to explain which services were changed or removed

### [Modify the infrastructure to increase performance and redundancy](https://github.com/herrera-luis/cloud_architect_resources/blob/master/Design%20for%20Performance%20and%20Scalability/Estimate%20Costs/Increased_Cost%20Estimate.csv) 

* Infrastructure has been re-designed for increased performance and redundancy
* The monthly cost is between $18,000-20,000 using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator
* A rationale is provided to explain which services were changed or removed
